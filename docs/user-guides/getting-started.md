## Sign up

If you are not already signed in, click on Sign In button on top right corner.

To proceed you will need Metamask installed. If you don't, install it by clicking on "Get Metamask".

Since COCO is live on Rinkeby-Arbitrum, you will have to switch metmask to Rinkeby-Arbitrum network to proceed further. If you haven't already, click on "Switch to Rinkeby Arbitrum".

Once your wallet is connected, you will be asked to "Sign login message" and a signature request will pop up on metamask.
The message asks you to sign your hot wallet address & login nonce, that is used for frequent interactions with COCO.
Once you sign, you will be logged in.

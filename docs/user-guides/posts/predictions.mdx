After selecting post, use the dashboard on right side of the page to place predicitions.

Since we want to place a prediction, select BUY, among BUY or SELL option, on the dashboard.
To place YES prediction, buy YES outcome shares. To place NO prediction,
buy NO outcome share.

Enter WETH amount for which you want to buy either YES or NO outcome shares, select
slippage, check Estimated shares bought, Avg. Price, Max. profit, and then hit `BUY`.
Confirm the transaction & wait for it to process. Once processed, you have successfully
placed your prediction.

caused by other orders. We recommend that you set your slippage at value >= 0.5%.

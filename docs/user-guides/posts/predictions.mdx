title: Make Predictions

Making predictions is how you participate in curating what shows
up in the feeds you care about.

If you see `Live` on the top right corner of a post, the prediction
period is open for that post and you can help decide whether or not it
should stay in the feed.

		require("./../../../static/img/user-guides/post-live-text.jpg").default
	}
	caption={`"Live" indicates post is in the Prediction Period. So, make your predictions.`}
/>

After selecting a post, use the dashboard on the right side of the page
to make your prediction.

To make a prediction, select `BUY` on the dashboard.

The current price per YES or NO share reflects the probability of each
outcome, based on YES and NO shares bought so far. **More probable
outcome = higher share price.**

Enter the WETH amount you want to spend on either YES or NO outcome shares
and set your slippage, then check your estimated shares bought, average
price, maximum winnings and new YES/NO% to make sure you're getting the result you intended.

:::info
`Slippage`: The price of shares is approximate, and can change right before (due to
other orders in queue) your order is executed. To prevent your order executing at
unexpected price, you define slippage. It's usually minimal - but it helps you
decide how much of a variance you're willing to put up with. <br/>
`Your choice`: The outcome you're predicting. <br/>
`Estimated shares bought`: Number of shares you will receive based on the WETH
amount you've entered. <br/>
`Avg. price per share`: Price per outcome share in WETH. <br/>
`Max. potential winnings`: Maximum WETH you could win, if your prediction is
correct <br/>
`New YES% Probability`/ `New NO % Probability`: Shows how the shares you're buying
will impact the outcome probability.<br/>

Hit `Buy` and confirm the transaction in MetaMask. Once it's confirmed, you've made your
prediction and done your part to keep your group's feed excellent and spam-free!

You should see your recently bought shares next to `You own` under the outcome
you bought shares for.

		require("./../../../static/img/user-guides/post-you-own-shares.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={`Value next to "You own" represent shares you own of the outcome.`}
/>

If your transaction shows as confirmed on MetaMask and you don't see your shares,
you might need to reload the page.

:::caution
Remember that as long as the prediction period remains open, other users can
continue to make predictions of their own which could change the outcome.
Keep an eye on posts where you've made predictions, and be ready to
[challenge](challenges) if you think the outcome isn't correct.

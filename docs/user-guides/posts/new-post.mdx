	}
	caption={`Click on "New Post"`}
/>

Select group to post to, enter Creation Amount, upload post image and hit `Post`. <br/>

Since every post also has an on-chain prediction market, confirm the transaction
to create one for your new post. Once transaction is processed your post has been created successfully.

:::info

`Creation Amount` is the amount you are willing to pay for posting in the group. <br/>
1/2 of the amount is used for funding the prediction market of your post, so that
others willing to place their predictions on your post have sufficient incentive to do so. <br/>
Second half 1/2 is used for placing your YES predicition on the your new post.

title: Create New Post

import { Image } from "./../../common.js";

To post, click `New Post` on the left side panel of home page.

	}
	caption={`Click on "New Post"`}
/>

Select the group you want to post to and enter your Creation Value. <br/>

:::info

`Creation Value` is the amount you are willing to pay to post to the group.
If the prediction outcome ends up being YES, you'll get the Creation Value
back and potentially more; but you could also lose it if the outcome is NO.
So the Creation Value should reflect your confidence that the post belongs
in the group's feed - but it shouldn't be more than you're willing to lose
if you're wrong! <br/>

While the post is in the prediction period, users place YES & NO predicitions
by buying respective outcome shares. Half of your Creation Value is used
to add intial YES & NO outcome shares for facilitating subsequent predicitions.
Other half of Creation Value is used to buy YES outcome shares for yourself,
thus placing your YES prediction on the post. Consequently, every new post starts
with 80% YES probability of being on the feed.

:::info

We recommend a Creation Value of `0.01 - 0.1 WETH` while on Testnet, just so
that you can experience the fun of using COCO.

Now upload the image you want to share, and hit `Post`.

Predictions for each post are hosted on chain while the prediction period is
live, so you'll need to submit a transaction to initiate the prediction period
for your new post. Once the transaction is processed, your post will show up
on the group feed where other users can see and make predictions on it.

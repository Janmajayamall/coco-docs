title: Waiting for Resolutoin
---

import { Image } from "./../../common.js";

A post only enters `Resolution period`, if max. no. of challenges
are reached. During this period we are waiting for group's governing
body to declare the final outcome. <br/>
Posts in resolution period will have `Resolution` text on their
top right corner.

When a post's prediction period ends, whichever outcome (YES or NO)
has the highest probability % will be set as the _temporary outcome_.
During the challenge period, you can stake WETH to challenge the
temporary outcome in favour of the outcome that you think is right.
Your challenge will automatically change the temporary outcome -
but another user can challenge again and change the outcome back.
To prevent an infinite challenge loop, the group's governing body
sets a limit on the number of times an outcome can be challenged
before they step in to review the post and decide the outcome.

<!-- add: what you get if you win the challenge -->

:::info
Once the challenge period ends and final outcome is set, you get
back the amount you staked in favour of the final outcome.

If you were last to stake in favour of the final outcome,
you also _win_ the entire amount staked by others on the
losing outcome.
:::

A post that's in the challenge period will say `Challenge`
in red at the top right corner.

To challenge a post, click on the post and look for the
`Challenge Outcome` dashboard to the right of the page.

:::info

`Temporary outcome`: Current temporary outcome, which will be
declared as the final outcome if it isn't challenged. <br/>
`Time remaining`: How much time is left in the challenge period,
after which the temporary outcome will become final. <br/>
`Challenges left`: Number of challenges left before the post
is sent to the governing body for resolution. <br/>
`Min. amount to challenge`: Minimum amount to you need to stake
in order to challenge the temporary outcome. <br/>
`Outcome favored`: Outcome that you think is correct - this
will be set as the new temporary outcome once you submit your challenge.

<!-- would it make sense to have "maximum winnings" here too...? -->

:::

Check the values under `Challenge outcome` heading, enter challenge amount, and hit
`Challenge`. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to process. Once processed,
you have successfully challenged the temporary outcome.

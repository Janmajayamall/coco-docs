After a final outcome is decided, users who made predictions or challenges in favor
of the correct outcome can redeem the WETH they put in plus any extra they've won.

Once a final outcome has been declared, you'll see `Final` in green at the top
right corner of the post.

Select a post to redeem. On the right side of the page, under `Final outcome`,
you'll find a summary of your participation and winnings.

:::info

`Your outcome shares`: WETH value of outcome shares that you own. <br/>
`In favour of YES`: Amount you staked to challenge in favour of a YES outcome. <br/>
`In favour of NO`: Amount you staked to challenge in favour of a NO outcome. <br/>
`Challenge winnings`: Your reward if you were last to challenge in favour of the correct
outcome, equal to the total staked on the losing outcome minus the resolution fee if applicable. <br/>
`Total from Challenge`: Amount staked for the right outcome + Challenge winnings. <br/>
`Resolution Fee`: Fee taken by the governing body if they were required to declare an outcome. <br/>
`You get back in total`: Your outcome shares + Total from Challenge

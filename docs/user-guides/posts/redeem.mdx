Post's prediction market ends after final outcome is declared and you can redeem your wins.
This is also indicated by `Ended` text on top right corner.

`Final outcome` is either set by group's governing body if max. no. of challenges are reached
or as temporary outcome if it wasn't challenged.

Select the post from which you want to redeem your wins. One the right side of the page,
under `Final outcome` you will find summary of your predictions, your wins from predictions,
your challenges, wins from challanges, and total amount that you get back.
Hit `Claim` & confirm transaction to claim your wins.

`Your trade winnings`: Equal to units of final outcome shares that you own. <br/>
`In favour of YES`: Amount you staked to challenge in favour of YES outcome. <br/>

`Challenge winnings`: Reward you receive if you were last to stake on the right
outcome. Reward is equal to total amount staked on the losing outcome. <br/>

:::note

It's possible that the `Claim` button is disabled because you haven't given app's
router contract approval to spend your outcome shares on your behalf.

To give approval click on `Giver Approval` & confirm transaction.

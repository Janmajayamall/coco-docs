### Sign up

You will need MetaMask installed. If you don't already have MetaMask, click
on "Get Metamask" and follow the instructions to install.

Since Coco is live on the Rinkeby-Arbitrum test network, you will have to switch MetaMask to
Rinkeby-Arbitrum to proceed further. If you haven't already, click on "Switch
to Rinkeby Arbitrum".

<!-- should we add a note about how to add Arbitrum to MetaMask? -->

Now connect your MetaMask wallet to Coco.

/>

Once your wallet is connected, you will be asked to "Sign login message", and a
signature request will pop up on MetaMask. The message asks you to sign your hot
wallet address & login nonce, to be used for frequent interactions with Coco.
Once you sign, you will be logged in.

### Explore and Home Feeds

Your home page by default consists of two feeds: <br/>
(a) **Explore Feed** consists of the most active posts across all group feeds
during the past week. <br/>
(b) **Home Feed** consists of all posts from the groups that you have
joined, sorted by latest.

### Join groups

You can find groups to join on the right side of the home page, under the
heading **Explore Groups**.

### Group feeds

To visit a group's feed, select the group's name under **Explore groups**
on the right side of the home page.

	caption={"Select group to visit group's feed"}
/>

### Display threshold

The slider under "Display" on the left, controls the YES % threshold of your feed.

<Image
	src={
		require("./../../static/img/getting-started/display-threshold.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={
		"Threshold is set to 50%. Post with probability >= 50% only appear on feed"
	}
/>

Only posts with a percentage of YES (%) probability greater than the value you
set here will appear on your feed. This lets you filter out posts that the
group has predicted won't be included, even before the prediction period
for those posts ends.

### Sign up

If you are not already signed in, click on Sign In button on top right corner.

To proceed you will need Metamask installed. If you don't, install it by clicking on "Get Metamask".

Since COCO is live on Rinkeby-Arbitrum, you will have to switch metmask to Rinkeby-Arbitrum network to proceed further. If you haven't already, click on "Switch to Rinkeby Arbitrum".

	src={
		require("./../../static/img/getting-started/mm-switch-network.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={"Metamask Switch to Rinkeby-Arbitrum"}
/>

Now connect your Metamask wallet to COCO.

	src={
		require("./../../static/img/getting-started/mm-connect-wallet.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={"Metamask connect to COCO"}
/>

Once your wallet is connected, you will be asked to "Sign login message" and a signature request will pop up on metamask.
The message asks you to sign your hot wallet address & login nonce, that is used for frequent interactions with COCO.
Once you sign, you will be logged in.

### Join groups

You can find groups to join on the right side of the home page, under the heading **Explore Groups**.

### Explore & Home Feed

Your home page by default consists of two feeds - Explore feed & Home feed.
Explore feed consists of the most active posts across all group feeds during the past week.
Home feed consists of all posts posted across the groups that you have joined in sorted by latest.

### Group feed

To visit the dedicated feed of a group, select the group's name under **Explore groups** section to your right on home page.

<Image
	src={require("./../../static/img/getting-started/select-group.jpg").default}
	caption={"Select group to visit its dedicated feed"}
/>

### Display threshold

The slider under "Display" to your left, adjusts YES % threshold of your feed.

<Image
	src={
		require("./../../static/img/getting-started/display-threshold.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={
		"Threshold is set to 50%. Post with probability >= 50% only appear on feed"
	}
/>

By setting YES % threshold at specific value, only posts with YES probability greater than your set value will appear on your feed.

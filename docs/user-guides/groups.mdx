Every group has an on-chain contract that hosts the predictions on the posts on the
group feed. The cotract will be deployed with the parameters you set now, but you
can change them later.

:::info

`Prediction Period`: Length of time where users are able to make YES or NO
predictions after the post is created. <br/>
`Challenge Period`: Length of time after the prediction period ends when
users can challenge an outcome before it becomes final. <br/>
`Max. no. of Challenges`: Hard cap on how many times a temporary outcome
can be challenged. Once the limit is reached, the group's moderator
is responsible for declaring the outcome. <br/>
`Resolution Period`: Time limit for the group's moderator to declare
the final outcome of a post that has reached the maximum number of challenges.
If moderator fails to declare an outcome before resolution period expires,
the final outcome is set as the last temporary outcome. <br/>
`Resolution Fee`: Fee taken by group's moderator for declaring the
final outcome, as a percent taken from the amount staked on the losing
challenge outcome. <br/>

You'll need to submit a transaction in MetaMask to create the on-chain contract
for your new group.

		"Fill in group details and confirm transaction to create your new group"
	}
/>

Once the transaction is processed, your new group is created and you will be
redirected to the group settings page. On the Settings page, you can check and
update the group's configurations. <br/> Since you have just created the group,
you should update group's description to let other users know what the
group is about.

### Moderating groups

For now, if you create a group, you act as group's moderator. If you
want to cooperate with other people on moderation, you'll currently
need to coordinate externally. That will change with future releases - we're
working on ways to add more than one person to act as group's moderator within
the app so that moderation can be done in a more decentralized way.

To find groups you created and moderate, select "Your Groups" from the dropdown
menu at the top right of the page.

### Resolving Prediction Outcomes

Under `Posts To Review` at the center of the page, you will find list of posts from your
groups which have reached the maximum number of challenges and require resolution by the moderator.

<Image
	src={
		require("./../../static/img/user-guides/posts-to-review-list.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={""}
/>

Select the post you want to resolve. On the right side, select the outcome you
think is correct and click `Declare Outcome`. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to
process. Once processed, reload the page to check that status is updated to `Ended`.

	caption={"Select Create new group from dropdown"}
/>

Fill up necessary details for your new group and hit "Submit". Creating a group requires a transaction to create an on-chain contract for your new group, thus "Confirm" the transaction.

		require("./../../static/img/user-guides/create-new-group-tx.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={
		"Fill up group details & confirm transaction to create your new group"
	}
/>

Once transaction is processed, your new group is created and you will be redirected to the group settings page. On settings page, you can check & update group's configurations. <br/>
Since you have just created the group, you should update group's description, so that users can know what the group is about.

	}
/>

Since you created the group, you are the only one part of group's governing body. At present, there exists no way to add & manage groups
with more than one person in governing body. Thus we suggest that you coordinate the governing body with more than one person externally
(i.e. on discord, telegram) and reflect body's decisions on app using your account.

### Governing groups

To find groups you created & govern, select "Your groups" from menu dropdown at top right. Your groups are list on right side of the page under "Your Groups".

		require("./../../static/img/user-guides/your-groups-dropdown.jpg")
			.default
	}
	caption={"Select Your groups from dropdown"}
/>

Under "Posts To Review" at the center of the page, you will list of posts from your groups for which you have to declare the outcome.

	}
	caption={"List of posts to declare outcome for"}
/>

### Declaring outcome of Post's prediction market

To declare outcome of a post, select the post. On the right side, under declare outcome, select the outcome to declare and click on "Declare Outcome".
Confirm the transaction and wait for it to process. Once processed, reload the page to check that status is updated to "Ended" and outcome is declared.

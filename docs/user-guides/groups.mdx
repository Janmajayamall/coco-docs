Fill up necessary details for your new group, then "Submit". Every group has a on-chain contract that hosts prediction market of posts posted on its feed & its configurations.

	}
/>

If you want add more people to group's governing body, at present there exists no way to do this within the app. You will have to create & coordinate the governing body externally (i.e. discord, telegram, etc.) and then reflect the decision on the app using your account.

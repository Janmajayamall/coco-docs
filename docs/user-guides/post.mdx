	caption={`Click on "New Post"`}
/>

Select group to post to, enter Creation Amount, upload post image and hit `Post`. <br/>

Since every post also has an on-chain prediction market, confirm the transaction
to create one for your new post. Once transaction is processed your post has been created successfully.

:::info

`Creation Amount` is the amount you are willing to pay for posting in the group. <br/>
1/2 of the amount is used for funding the prediction market of your post, so that
others willing to place their predictions on your post have sufficient incentive to do so. <br/>
Second half 1/2 is used for placing your YES predicition on the your new post.

#### Placing predicition on posts (Prediction period)

Select the post to place your predicton. The `Live` text on post's top right indicates
that the post is in `Prediction period` and accepts predictions.

After selecting post, use the dashboard on right side of the page to place predicitions.

Since we want to place a prediction, select BUY, among BUY or SELL option, on the dashboard.

buy NO outcome share.

Enter WETH amount for which you want to buy either YES or NO outcome shares, select
slippage, check Estimated shares bought, Avg. Price, Max. profit, and then hit `BUY`.
Confirm the transaction & wait for it to process. Once processed, you have successfully
placed your prediction.

`Slippage` is required to prevent your order from executing at a unfavourable price
caused by other orders. We recommend that you set your slippage at value >= 0.5%.

#### Resolution Period

If max. no. of challenges are reached for any post's prediction market, it enters `Resolution period`.
That is, the market is waiting for group's moderator to declare the final outcome.

Posts in resolution period will have `Resolution` text on their top right corner.

#### Redeem Wins

Post's prediction market ends after final outcome is declared and you can redeem your wins.
This is also indicated by `Ended` text on top right corner.

or as temporary outcome if it wasn't challenged.

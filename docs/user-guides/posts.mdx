Select group to post to, enter Creation Amount, upload post image and hit `Post`. <br/>

Since every post also has an on-chain prediction market, confirm the transaction
to create one for your new post. Once transaction is processed your post has been created successfully.

:::info

`Creation Amount` is the amount you are willing to pay for posting in the group. <br/>
1/2 of the amount is used for funding the prediction market of your post, so that
others willing to place their predictions on your are post have sufficient incentive to do so. <br/>
Second half 1/2 is used for placing your YES predicition on the your new post.

Enter WETH amount for which you want to buy either YES or NO outcome shares, select slippage, check Estimated shares bought,
Avg. Price, Max. profit, and then hit `BUY`. Confirm the transaction & wait for it to process. Once processed, you have successfully
placed your prediction.

you set your slippage at value >= 0.5%.

#### Resolution Period

If max. no. of challenges are reached for any post's prediction market, the market enters the Resolution period. That is, the market is waiting for governing body of the group to declare the final outcome.

A post in resolution period will have "Resolution" text on its top right corner.

#### Redeem Wins

Once the final outcome is declared, either as the temporary outcome or governing body declared it, the market ends. Post's with their prediction market ended, will have "Ended" text on their top right. In "Ended" state you can redeem your wins.

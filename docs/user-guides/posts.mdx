#### Placing predicition on posts (Trading period)

Select the post to place your predicton. The **Live** text on post's top right indicates that the post is in **Trading period** and accepts predictions.

<Image

	caption={`"Live" green text indicates post is in Trading Period. Place your predictions.`}
/>

After selecting post, use the dashboard on right side of the page to place predicitions.

Since we want to place prediction, select BUY on the dashboard from BUY or SELL. To place either YES or NO predicition, buy YES or NO outcome shares respectively.

Once you enter the WETH amount using which you want to buy either YES or NO outcome shares, you will notice few values below input box change. These values are <br/>

1. Your choice: Outcome share you are buying in exchange of WETH amount.
2. Estimated shares bought: Total shares you will by with WETH amount.
3. Avg. price per share: Price in WETH that you pay for an outcome share.
4. Max. potential profit: Your Max. profit in WETH (i.e. profit you make if your prediction is right).

By default slippage is set to 0.5%. Slippage is required to prevent your order from executing at a unfavourable price caused by other orders,
thus recommended slippage is >=0.5%.

Click "Buy" & confirm transaction to buy outcome shares & place your predicition.

Select a post in Challenge period. On the right side of the page, you will find challenge dashboard. It displays a few important values -

1. Temporary outcome: The current temporary outcome. If the outcome isn't challenged successfully before challenge period expires, it is declared the final outcome.
2. Time left to challenge - Time left for current challenge period to expire.

4. Min. amount to challenge - Amount in WETH to stake to challenge temporary outcome.

#### Resolution Period

If max. no. of challenges are reached for any post's prediction market, the market enters the Resolution period. That is, the market is waiting for governing body of the group to declare the final outcome.

A post in resolution period will have "Resolution" text on its top right corner.

#### Redeem Wins

Once the final outcome is declared, either as the temporary outcome or governing body declared it, the market ends. Post's with their prediction market ended, will have "Ended" text on their top right. In "Ended" state you can redeem your wins.

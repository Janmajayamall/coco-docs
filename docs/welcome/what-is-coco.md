# What's COCO?

COCO is a place for groups to have dedicated curated feed on interesting topics.

Group feeds on COCO are quite different from feeds on other platforms. They are curated, using prediction markets, to contain only posts that are suitable for the group's topic and liked by other users.

So for example, think that there is a group for **Top crypto MEMES of the week** governed by a few Meme experts. The curation mechanism of COCO makes sure that only the **TOP** memes of the week stay on the group feed.

Coco lets groups collaborate on curating a feed dedicated to a topic they're interested in.

In Coco, rather than simply "like" or "dislike" a post, you _predict_ whether the post will be included in the feed, and other users do the same. If a majority of users agree, the post goes in the feed; if not, it's buried. Every group has _moderators_ that can step in to make a decision if the group does not agree.

For example, in a group dedicated to **Top Crypto Memes of the Week**, Coco's curation mechanism lets the group keep the feed exclusive to the **TOP** memes, whereas a **Crypto Memes That Deserve to Live** group might be a little more . It's up to the group to agree on what fits the topic!

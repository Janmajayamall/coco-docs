# Overview of how COCO works

Everyone (an individual or a group) is free to create groups on interesting topics & a group has a dedicated governing body. Scope of topics for groups is unlimited. It can be about Funniest memes of the month, or Best articles on crypto, or UI designs, or Top bars in Switzerland, or anything you can imagine.

Like any other feed, anyone is free to post to the group's feed but with a twist. To post, users make a prediction of YES that their post will be liked by other users & the group's governing body. If some user does not like what you posted, they can make a prediction of NO that other users & the governing body will not like the post. Your prediction will either be right or wrong, depending on the final outcome declared.

## So how do YES & NO predictions on posts translate to curation of the feed?

To understand this, first let's look at how you place your predictions. You place YES and NO predictions on the prediction market of the post. Post's prediction market is simply a binary event market, where a YES prediction means users & group's governing body will like the post and a NO prediction means otherwise.

One fascinating feature of prediction markets is that prices for placing YES & NO predictions are accurate estimations of probability of YES & NO outcomes. And this is where post prediction markets become helpful in curation of the feed.

Price of predicting YES or NO provides probability by which users & governing body will like the post. Thus, a group's curated feed simply contains a list of posts with high YES probability.

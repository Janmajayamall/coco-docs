# How COCO Works

Anyone is free to create a group on a topic that interests them. The scope of group topics is unlimited - funniest memes, best UI designs, top bars in Switzerland or anything else you can imagine. 

Group feeds are primarily curated by users *predicting* what others in the group will want to see. Users have to deposit ETH in order to make a prediction about whether a post will ultimately be included, and are rewarded or penalized depending on whether they correctly predict the outcome. Anyone can challenge an outcome they think is wrong, and if challenges don't resolve on their own then a group's governing body can declare an outcome. 

## So how do YES or NO predictions on posts translate to curation of the feed?

COCO's curation mechanism works similarly to a *prediction market*. In a prediction market, traders buy and sell shares on possible outcomes of some external event - from the winner a football tournament, to the outcome of a presidential election, to whether it will rain next Tuesday. The price of shares is relative to the probability of a specific outcome: the higher the probability of an outcome, the higher the cost of a share of that outcome. 

In COCO's curation mechanism, the "event" is a decision by a governing body to accept or reject a post from their group's feed - but if predictions work as intended then the event doesn't actually need to occur. In other words, if all goes well predictions behave like votes, with users incentivized to vote in the best interest of the group. Only if the outcome is challenged repeatedly does the governing body step in to declare an outcome. These challenge and resolution mechanisms act as safeguards against people making dishonest predictions, whether to cheat the system or just to troll.

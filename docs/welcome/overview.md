# How Coco Works

Anyone is free to create a group on a topic that interests them. The scope of group topics is unlimited - funniest memes, best UI designs, top bars in Switzerland or anything else you can imagine.

Group feeds are primarily curated by users _predicting_ what others in the group will want to see. Users spend WETH to place predictions on whether a post will ultimately be liked by other users and the group'md. If their prediction is right, they win some WETH; otherwise they lose their initial amount. The _favored_ outcome is set as the outcome predicted by the majority at the end of the prediction period - but anyone can challenge it. If several challenges don't resolve to a clear outcome, then the group's moderator declares the outcome.

## So how do YES or NO predictions on posts translate to curation of the feed?

Coco's curation mechanism works similarly to a _prediction market_. In a prediction market, traders buy and sell shares on possible outcomes of some external event - from the winner of a football tournament, to the outcome of a presidential election, to whether it will rain next Tuesday. The price of outcome shares are good estimates of probability of respective outcomes. This means a higher price of YES share corresponds to higher probability of the event resulting in YES.

In Coco's curation mechanism, the "event" is whether moderators accept or reject a post from their group's feed - but if predictions work as intended then the event doesn't actually need to occur. In other words, if all goes well predictions behave like votes, with users putting their money at stake to back their votes. The favored outcome is assumed to be correct after the prediction period ends, unless it is challenged. Only if the favored outcome is challenged repeatedly does the moderators step in to declare an outcome. You can think of the challenge and resolution mechanisms as safeguards against people making dishonest predictions, whether to cheat the system or just to troll.

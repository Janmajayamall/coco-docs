title: Groups, Markets & Curation
---

Group parameters and post prediction markets enable two important properties for having high quality curated group feeds.

1. They scale curation, without compromising quality.
   They make sure that group's governing body declare outcomes in very rare cases, while enforcing users placing bets to base their bets on what governing body would think. This helps scale curation capabilities of a group's feed.
2. Curated content is a reflection of what posts users like on group's feed.
   Users place bets on their judgement of what governing body would think about the post. Which reflects the quality of content that users in general expect on group's feed.

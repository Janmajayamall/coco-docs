title: Groups and Moderators
---

Group can be on any topic of interest. In addition to examples mentioned before,
you can have groups for **Top Articles to read for the week**, **Top NFTs of the month**,
**Most fascinating podcasts in crypto**, and many more.

Group moderator (support for several moderators will be added in near future) should
be expected to have sufficient knowledge about the topic of the group. For example, a
group for **Best articles on crypto** should have moderator(s) with in-depth knowledge
about crypto.

Moderator sets parameters of the group that affect curation of post's posted to the group.

1.  `Prediction Period` - Duration for which users can place predictions after post
    the created. It is represented in hours and can range from hours, to days, to
    even weeks, depeding on the group. For example, a group for **Top MEMEs of the week**
    might have a prediction period of 1 - 2 days. Or a group for **Most informative article on crypto**
    might have prediction period of a week.
2.  `Challenge Period` - Time during which temporary outcome can be challenged. `Challenge period`
    starts right after `Prediction Period` expires with the favored outcome set as `temporary outcome`.
    `Challenge period` renews after every successful challange and can range from hours to days.
    While setting a value for Challenge period, it's helpful to reason about how long would it
    take for users to spot that the temporary outcome isn't correct and challange it.
3.  `Max. no. of Challenges` - Puts a hard cap on how many times temporary outcomes can be challenged.
    Once the limit is reached, moderator is responsible for declaring the outcome for
    the post. The Hard cap is needed for 2 reasons. (a) So that challenges don't go on forever.
    (b) Enforce that group's moderator has final take on whether post is suitable for group's
    feed or not.
4.  `Resolution Period` - Time needed for the group's moderator to declare the final outcome
    of a post that has reached `max. no. of Challenges`. It exists so that the moderator does
    not takes forever to declare outcomes. If moderator fails to declare outcome before
    resolution period expires, the final outcome is set as the last temporary outcome. This
    obviously isn't desired. But if it happens it will send a bad signal about the governing
    body not performing its job.
5.  `Resolution Fee` - Fee levied by group's moderator for declaring the final outcome
    The fee can range from 0-100% and is charged from the amount staked on the
    losing outcome during Challanges. For example, assume that resolution fee
    for a group is set as 0.1% and max. number of challenges for a post were reached,
    ending with 1 WETH staked on NO and 2 WETH staked on YES. If group's moderator
    declares YES as the final outcome, it will charge 0.1 WETH (0.1% of 1 WETH, the amount
    staked on losing outcome) as the resolutoin fee.

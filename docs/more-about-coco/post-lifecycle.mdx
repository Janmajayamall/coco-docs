title: Life-cycle of a Post
---

When creating a post in the group, the creator enters `Creation Amount` equal to amount in WETH they
are willing to pay for posting. First half of Creation Amount is used for funding post's
prediction market needed to incentivise other users to place their predictions. Second half
is used for placing creator's YES prediction.

Once post is created, it enters the `Trading Period` followed by `Challenge Period`.

### Trading Period

During this period users place their predictions on the post. They buy `YES` shares if they like the post
and think that it is suitable for the group or `NO` shares if they think otherwise.

This period lasts for some amount of time (can range from hours to days) set by group's governing body.
Once the period expires, the post transitions to `Challenge period` and the favoured outcome is set
as the temporary outcome.`Favoured outcome` is the outcome of which more shares have been bought
compared to the other. For example, if more YES shares have been bought than NO shares in a post's
prediction market then YES is the favoured outcome & will be set as the temporary outcome.

### Challenge Period

During challenge period anyone can challenge the temporary outcome of the post. If a user
thinks that the temporary outcome isn't correct, they can challenge it by staking some amount
in favour of the other outcome. After every challenge period, the favored outcome is set as
the new temporary outcome and the challenge period renews.

Challenges work similar to double or nothing lawsuits. To challenge the current temporary
outcome, the minimum amount you need to stake is double the amount staked in last challenge.
If there are no prior challeneges, the amount simply needs to be greater than 0 WETH.

If temporary outcome isn't challenged before the challenge period expires, the post market
resolves and the temporary outcome is set as the final outcome.

If no. of challenges reach the maximum no. of challenges allowed, the post is escalated
to group's governing body for it to declare the final outcome. The group's governing body
is expected to declare the outcome within `Resolution period`.

### Resolution Period

The post enters `Resolution period` only when max. no. of challenges are reached. During this
period, the governing body is expected to declare the final outcome for the post.

If governing body fails to declare the outcome, the last temporary outcome is set as the
final outcome. Occurance of failure is a signal to users that the governing body isn't
performing its job correctly.

### Resolved

Post's predicition market resolves once final outcome is set, either by group's governing body
or as temporary outcome when not challenged. Users can now redeem their winnings.

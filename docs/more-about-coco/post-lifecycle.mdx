title: Post & Prediction market
---

As mentioned, the creator of the post is the first to place bet that "YES" other users & governing body will like their feed. Before placing their bet, post creator also creates & provide some liquiduty to their post's prediction market. This is done to incentivise other users to place bets on the post's market.

Once post creator creates post's prediction market, the markets enters the Trading Period. Every market has two periods - Trading period followed by Challenge period (both are decribed below). After the challenge period the market is resolved and either YES or NO is declared as the final outcome.

#### Trading Period

During trading period anyone can place their bet on post's prediciton market. You place your bet by buying YES or NO shares of the market. If you think that other users & governing body will like the post, then you should buy "YES" shares. If you think otherwise, then you should buy "NO" shares.

Trading period lasts for a specifed amount of time (can range from hours to days). The group's governing body decides trading period for posts posted to the group. Once trading period expires, the market enters the Challenge period and the favoured outcome is set as the temporary outcome. Favoured outcome is the outcome of which more shares have been bought compared to the other. For example, if more YES shares have been bought than NO shares in a post's prediction market then YES is the favoured outcome & will be set as the temporary outcome.

#### Challenge Period

During challenge period anyone can challenge the temporary outcome. If you think that the temporary outcome is not correct you can stake some amount in favour of the other outcome, to challenge the temporary outcome. Once you challenge, your favoured outcome is set as the new temporary outcome and the challenge period renews.

The challenge rounds work similar to double or nothing lawsuits. To challenge the current temporary outcome, the minimum amount you need to stake is double the amount staked in last challenge round. If you are the first to challenge after Challenge period starts, you can stake any amount greater than 0.

If a temporary outcome does not receives any challenge before the challenge period expires, then the market resolves and the temporary outcome is set as the final outcome. If round of challenges reach the maximum round of challenges allowed, the market is escalated to group governing the feed for resolving the market. The group governing the feed also sets time limit for challenge period and the maximum round challenges allowed.

#### Market Resolved

Once the market resolves to either YES or NO, you can redeem your winnings. Market is resolved to the temporary outcome, if it wasn't challenged or to outcome declared by the group governing body, if maximum limit of challenge rounds were reached.

You can redeem 1 WETH for 1 share of winning outcome. For example, if YES is declared as the final outcome, you can redeem 1 WETH for every YES share you own. If, in rare cases, the outcome is declared to UNDECIDED, then you can redeem 0.5 WETH for every YES or NO share you own. UNDECIDED outcome means neither YES or NO can be declared as the final outcome.

If you staked amount for challenging a temporary outcome and the outcome you favoured is declared as the final outcome, you get your stake back. If you are the last one to stake in favour of the outcome declared as final outcome, you also receive entire amount staked for the losing outcome (after deducting governing body's fee only in cases when they declare the outcome) as a reward. In cases when governing body decalares the final outcome, that is maximum challenge rounds were reached, they may deduct some percentage from the losing stake, as their fee.

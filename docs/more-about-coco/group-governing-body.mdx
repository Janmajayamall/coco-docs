title: Group & Governing body
---

A group can be around any topic of interest. In addition to examples mentioned before, you can have feed for Top Articles to read for the week, or Top NFTs of the month, Most fascinating podcasts in crypto, and many more.

Group's governing body can be of any size and should be expected to have sufficient knowledge about the topic of the group. For example, a group for Best articles on crypto should have governing body consisting of people with in-depth knowledge about crypto.

Group's governing body also sets parameters of the group that affects the curation of posts posted. There's no fixed rule for parameter values, and will change dependeing the group's topic. Parameters are as follows -

1. Trading Period -
   During trading period users can place their bets on post's prediction market after it is posted. It's is represented in hours. Trading period can range from hours, to days, to even weeks, and will depend on group's topic. For example, a group for Top MEME of the week might have a trading period of 1 - 2 days. Or a group for Most informative article on crypto might have trading period of a week.
2. Challenge Period -
   Challenge period starts right after Trading period expires. During challenge period anyone can challenge the temporary outcome by following the rules of the challenge round. Challenge period renews after every successful challenge. Challenge period can range from hours to days. During Challenge period users are expected to challenge temporary outcome that they think isn't right & should not be declared as the final outcome. Thus, it's helpful to reason about how long would it for users to spot and realise that temporary outcome isn't correct and challenge it.
3. Max. no. of Challenge rounds -
   Max. no. of challenge rounds puts a hard cap on how many times temporary outcomes can be challenged. Once the limit is reached, group's governing body declares the outcome for the post.
   Hard cap is needed for 2 reasons.

    - So that challenge rounds don't go on forever.
    - To enforce that the governing body has final take on whether post is suitable for group's feed (YES) or not (NO).

    Even though it's expected for max. challenge rounds to be reached in very rare cases, its existence enables users to reason about their bets & challenges (i.e think about whether governing body & others users will like & think that post is suitabe for group's feed or not).
    When deciding on a value for max. challenge rounds, it's quite helpful to reason about how often would the governing body want to interfere to declare the final outcome.

4. Resolution Period -
   Time needed for the group's governing body to declare the final outcome of a post that has reached max. challenge rounds. It's exists so that the governing body does not takes forever to declare outcomes.
   If governing body fails to declare outcome before resolution period expires, the outcome is set as the last temporary outcome. This obviously isn't desired. But if it happens it will send a bad signal about the governing body not performing its job.
5. Resolution Fee -
   Fee levied by group's governing body for declaring the final outcome. The fee can range from 0-100% and is charged from the amount staked on the losing outcome during the challenge round. For example, assume that resolution fee for a group is set as 0.1%. And max. number of challenges for a post were reached during the challenge round, ending with 1 WETH staked on NO and 2 WETH staked on YES. The group declares YES as the final outcome, thus will charge 0.1 WETH (0.1% of 1 WETH, the amount staked on losing outcome) as the resolutoin fee.
